Supplementary Data
==================

The zip file contains the folder of R code (**codes**) and datasets (**datasets**) that can reproduce the modeling and analyze result (in **outputs** folder) and visualize plots (in **plots** folder) and final report (in **reports** folder). All data will publicly release on Github after the paper published. The details and data pipelines are included in:

- **codes:** The source code to reproduce the modeling and analyze result that include:
  - *hill_two.stan:* Stan code of Hill model for the concentration-response modeling.
  - *0_mcmc_ind_chems.R*: R code for conducting the Hamiltonian Monte chain Monte Carlo simulation for individual chemicals.
  - *1_mcmc_mixtures.R*: R code for conducting the Hamiltonian Monte chain Monte Carlo simulation for mixtures.
  - *2_ec_10_pred.R*: R code to to estimate curve-fitting and predicted EC$_\textrm{10}$ in mixture for each phenotype. 
  - *3_conc_resp_pred.R*: R code to reconstruct the concentration-response profiles. 
  - *4_plot.R*: R codes to generate the figures in manuscript.
  - *5_plot_suppl.R*: R codes to generate the same figures in Supplemental Materials.

- **datasets:** The provided tidy data files include the individual chemical information (*chem_info.csv*) and cell assay results (*chem_data.csv*). The mixture information and cell assay results can be found in *mix_info.csv* and *mix_data.csv*. The data files contained the following columns:
  - *chemical*: Name of chemical.
  - *mixture*: Name of mixture.
  - *Replication*: Replication number. Two replications were conducted in individual chemicals. The mixtures had six replication. 
  - *Concentration*: Experimental concentration (unit = micromole). 
  - *Dilution*: Diluted factor according to the designed concentration in mixture.
  - *Response*: Response proportion that had been normalized (0 - 1) based on the control group.
  - *celltype*: Name of human induced pluripotent stem cells-derived cells.
  - *phenotype*: Cytotoxicity and functional phenotypes for each cell.

- **outputs**: The files in the output folder are generated by the above R code and datasets. The Bayesain estimated model parameters for individual chemicals were named like *HUVECs_42_chem_params.rda*. Also, the mixtures were named like *HUVECs_mixtures_params.rda*. The outputs of curve-fitting and predicted EC$_\textrm{10}$ in the mixture for each phenotype were stored in *ec_10_pred.rda*. Also, the calculated outputs to reconstruct the mixture concentration-response profile are in *mix_CR.rda*. 

- **plots:** All plots showed in the manuscript were saved in this folder. The **suppl**  folder includes the supplementary figures that showed below.
